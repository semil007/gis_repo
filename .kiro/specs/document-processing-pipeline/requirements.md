# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an automated document processing pipeline that converts semi-structured and unstructured PDF/DOCX files containing HMO (Houses in Multiple Occupation) licensing data into standardized CSV format. The system will provide a web-based interface for users to upload documents and receive processed CSV outputs with consistent column structure and data formatting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to upload PDF or DOCX files containing HMO licensing information, so that I can automatically convert them into standardized CSV format for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF file THEN the system SHALL accept the file and process it for data extraction
2. WHEN a user uploads a DOCX file THEN the system SHALL accept the file and process it for data extraction
3. WHEN a user uploads an unsupported file format THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating supported formats
4. WHEN the file size exceeds 100MB THEN the system SHALL display an error message about file size limits

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect and extract HMO licensing data from various document layouts, so that I don't need to manually format or structure the input documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes a semi-structured document THEN it SHALL identify and extract relevant HMO data fields
2. WHEN the system processes an unstructured document THEN it SHALL use intelligent parsing to locate HMO licensing information
3. WHEN the system encounters tables in documents THEN it SHALL extract tabular data while preserving relationships
4. WHEN the system finds address information THEN it SHALL parse and standardize address formats
5. WHEN the system identifies dates THEN it SHALL convert them to consistent YYYY-MM-DD format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want all processed outputs to follow a standardized CSV schema with configurable column mappings, so that I can consistently analyze data from different sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates output THEN it SHALL include configurable columns that can be mapped by users (default: council, reference, hmo_address, licence_start, licence_expiry, max_occupancy, hmo_manager_name, hmo_manager_address, licence_holder_name, licence_holder_address, number_of_households, number_of_shared_kitchens, number_of_shared_bathrooms, number_of_shared_toilets, number_of_storeys)
2. WHEN a user provides custom column names THEN the system SHALL use those names in the output CSV headers
3. WHEN data is missing for a field THEN the system SHALL leave the cell empty rather than inserting placeholder text
4. WHEN the system processes multiple documents THEN it SHALL maintain consistent column ordering across all outputs
5. WHEN generating CSV files THEN the system SHALL use proper CSV escaping for special characters and commas

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple web interface to upload documents and download results, so that I can easily use the system without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN they SHALL see a clean upload interface with drag-and-drop functionality
2. WHEN a user drags a file over the upload area THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
3. WHEN a user clicks the convert button THEN the system SHALL display processing status
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a download link for the CSV file
5. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the processing pipeline to be scalable and handle multiple concurrent uploads, so that the system can serve multiple users efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users upload files simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently without conflicts
2. WHEN the system is under load THEN it SHALL maintain response times under 30 seconds for files up to 10MB
3. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically up to 3 times before reporting failure
4. WHEN the system encounters memory issues THEN it SHALL process large documents in chunks to prevent crashes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use hybrid AI/ML methodologies for document processing, so that it can handle various document formats and layouts effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes documents THEN it SHALL use OCR for scanned PDFs and image-based content
2. WHEN the system extracts text THEN it SHALL use NLP techniques to identify relevant data fields
3. WHEN the system encounters structured tables THEN it SHALL use table detection algorithms
4. WHEN the system processes addresses THEN it SHALL use named entity recognition for location parsing
5. WHEN the system identifies patterns THEN it SHALL use machine learning models trained on HMO document formats

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance analyst, I want the system to validate extracted data and provide confidence scores, so that I can assess the reliability of the automated extraction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system extracts data THEN it SHALL assign confidence scores to each field
2. WHEN confidence scores are below 70% THEN the system SHALL flag those fields for manual review
3. WHEN the system detects inconsistent data formats THEN it SHALL attempt standardization and report success rates
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of extraction quality
5. WHEN validation fails for critical fields THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic records in the output

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious organization, I want the system to use only free and open-source technologies, so that we can deploy it without licensing costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL use only free and open-source libraries and frameworks
2. WHEN the system requires AI/ML capabilities THEN it SHALL use free models and services
3. WHEN the system needs OCR functionality THEN it SHALL use open-source OCR engines
4. WHEN the system requires cloud services THEN it SHALL be deployable on free tiers or self-hosted infrastructure
5. WHEN dependencies are added THEN they SHALL be verified as free and open-source with compatible licenses

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy the system on Ubuntu server with Git-based deployment, so that I can easily manage and update the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL be compatible with Ubuntu server environments
2. WHEN the code is pushed to Git repository THEN it SHALL include deployment scripts and documentation
3. WHEN cloning from server THEN the system SHALL provide simple command-line setup instructions
4. WHEN starting the application THEN it SHALL provide clear commands to launch the web interface
5. WHEN updating the system THEN it SHALL support Git pull and restart workflows

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a quality reviewer, I want a dedicated audit interface for manually reviewing flagged records, so that I can verify and correct low-confidence extractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN records are flagged for manual review THEN the system SHALL provide a separate audit page
2. WHEN a user accesses the audit page THEN they SHALL see all flagged records with confidence scores
3. WHEN reviewing a record THEN the user SHALL be able to edit extracted field values
4. WHEN corrections are made THEN the system SHALL update the CSV output with verified data
5. WHEN audit is complete THEN the system SHALL provide an updated CSV download with all corrections applied
